This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## The Iron Yard React Language Focus week 1. Activity: Scaffolding Practice - Pair Programming.

## Objectives  
Work with your peers to use create-react-app to start a React application. Use the starter files to help build your application and then follow the direction to successfully scaffold your project with the appropriate folders and distinct component files.

## Steps  

## During this activity:
Use npm run start to follow the progress and check for errors in your program.
Review the included screen shot to see how your application should look when rendered in the browser.
Familiarize yourself with create-react-app.
Discuss with partners the process of writing JSX and any differences from HTML that there might be.
Note the use of className and htmlFor and closing unpaired tags such as <input /> and <img />.
Continue editing until your content looks like the screenshots.
Iterate over static data and use it to render a list of actors in your application.

Stop frequently to compare and contrast your approaches to making React components and iteration over data.

##Getting Started  
This activity includes starter files for the app.css file, App.js file, index.html, and index.js. Download the following source folder and unpack it.

Copy the contents of the index.html file and paste them over the index.html file in your public directory in your application.
Copy the app.css file and paste it into your newly create app.css file generated by your create-react-app install in the src directory.

Also, copy the contents of the App.js file into your own App.js file. Then copy the contents of the attached index.js file over the index.js file in your create-react-app application. Make sure that you have created the appropriate folders such as a components folder and a styles folder so that your import statements are functional.

Copy the data folder with the actors.js file into your src directory.

## Activity: Part I  
Once everything is hooked up and running (and all proper folders have been created HINT: Follow the error messages) then extract each of the components from the App.js file and put them into their own files inside of your components folder. Then use import statements to bring them back into the App.js file and hook everything back up to render the page properly. Your App component should remain unchanged except for now receiving the other components through import statements.
You will need to create NavBar.js, Header.js, Section.js, Form.js, and Footer.js files in which each components of the same name are created and exported in the file.

## Activity: Part II  
After you have successfully completed Part I. Open your newly created Section.js file and look at your Section component.
Delete all of the list items in your component, keeping just the <section>, <img>, and <ul className="list-group"> tags in the return statement.

Use an import statement to import your actors.js file with the actors array from the data folder.
Using a map function, iterate over the array and return a <li></li> for each item. The <li> tag should have the following information:

` <li className="list-group-item" key={actor.id}>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>Name: {actor.name} </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Alias: {actor.also_known_as}</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Popularity (?/10): {actor.popularity}</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Birthday: {actor.birthday} </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>Date of Death: {actor.deathday === null ? "Still Alive" :  actor.deathday } </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Gender: {actor.gender === 1 ? "Female" : "Male" }</div>
      </li>
      <p>Biography: {actor.biography}</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
  `
  Place the newly created <li> in the <ul> in the return statement for the Section component. You should be rendering both Bill and Carrie's info in the browser (see screenshot).

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
